// Defines the particle system and composing particles for the General
// Leader Election Algorithm as alluded to in 'Leader Election and Shape
// Formation with Self-Organizing Programmable Matter'
// [https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07991].
//
// Please note that this distributed implementation of the algorithm described
// in the above paper has a chance of not working (which is related to the
// Segment Comparison subphase); however, the centralized algorithm described in
// the paper (which this distributed implementation is based on) is correct.
// Specifically, there is a possible order of activations when there are only
// two candidates in the Segment Comparison phase, where both candidates will
// demote themselves. This results in the boundary that the two candidates were
// on to lack any leader.
//
// Also note that the Solitude Verification phase of this algorithm was adapted
// from the Solitude Verification phase from the Improved Leader Election
// algorithm (see 'Improved Leader Election for Self-Organizing Programmable
// Matter' [https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03616]). This decision was made because
// the Solitude Verification phase in the Improved Leader Election algorithm
// is significantly simpler than this version's, and both Solitude Verification
// phases accomplish the same goals.
